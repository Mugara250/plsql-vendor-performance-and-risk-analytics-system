**Student Name:** Mbonyumugara Mushi
**Student ID:** 27906

## **Problem Statement**
Companies manually track vendor performance and have no automated way to control data access. This leads to inconsistent vendor evaluations and security gaps, with no proper audit trail for compliance requirements.

## **Key Objectives**
1. Automatically score vendors based on performance metrics
2. Restrict data modifications to weekends only (block weekdays/holidays)
3. Log all security violations for compliance auditing
4. Provide real-time vendor risk assessment
